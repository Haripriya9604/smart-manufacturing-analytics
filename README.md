## 📌 Project Overview
An **end-to-end predictive maintenance and business analytics framework** designed for **Industry 4.0 smart manufacturing systems**.  
The solution integrates **machine telemetry, time-series analytics, machine learning, and interactive dashboards** to predict equipment health, estimate **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)**, and enable **data-driven maintenance decisions**.

This project goes beyond isolated ML models by delivering a **scalable, ERP-ready analytics architecture** suitable for real industrial deployment.

## 🎯 Objectives
✔ Predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) using multivariate sensor data  
✔ Detect early-stage degradation and failure patterns  
✔ Support fleet-level and asset-level maintenance decisions  
✔ Deliver transparent and explainable ML predictions  
✔ Build a reusable analytics framework for manufacturing environments
